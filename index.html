                  <p>Currently, I am an undergraduate research assistant intern working under Prof. Anind Dey . There, I worked on developing a model which estimated the speed of autocorrection algorithms and accounted for accuracy. I then contributed to a paper about this model which was then submitted for peer review. Currently, I am building upon this research by desiging the optimal keyboard based on that model. Additionally, I am also contributing to a data visualization tool that clearly and efficiently displays cancer data for clinicians to use. This research experience has taught me invaluable lessons in software engineering, algorithm design, and the flexibility of computer science. It has motivated me to pursue a career in software engineering. Project details can be given upon request.</p>

                    <p> Broadly speaking, my iterests are practical, data-driven applications. By this, I mean any applications that use data in novel ways to the benefit of the largest number of users. I am currently looking for software engineering internships over the summer for companies that also further this interest. Data are playing an increasingly big part in HCI, my field of research. Because of this changing trend, I aim to leverage my understanding of data science to help design increasingly effective applications. I am currently looking for an internship at companies which would further my interest.</p>

                              In the summer of 2017, I, under the guidance of Nikola Banovic, worked to create a model that estimates the speed of autocorrection algorithms on mobile phone keyboards. From this model, we wrote a paper that we submitted for peer review. It is an improvement over existing models because it more accurately considers the cost of making errors. This is more practical since no one can type perfectly all the time.

                              <br> <br>
                              Based on this model, I am now working to create the optimal keyboard. Whereas other optimized IME's have been predicated on swapping the positions of certain keys, my work instead focuses on modifying the size of each individual key, thus maintaining the standard QWERTY layout of the keyboard. For a user, this approach is more natural since the standard QWERTY keyboard is so ubiquitous.

                            <p>Built with Apache Spark and SQL, this ongoing project dynamically accesses a database of cancer data and displays them to clinicians to help them make better recommendations to patients. It enables the user to simulate "what-if" scenarios based on patients with similar histories. We are working alongside researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). </p>

                            <p>EWB is an on-campus organization at CMU which specializes in doing service projects that apply engineering concepts to solve real-world problems. The goal of this project is to enable a drone to fly over crop fields in Rwanda and to take pictures of them. The pictures will then be stitched together and then analyzed to help Rwandan farmers identify where they need to add more irrigation and where they can have less. To this end, I am working on developing and testing navigation software.</p>

The algorithm traverses all possible positions that can arise from a given position. From there, it evaluates each position and compares it to the best possible position that it had seen. The grader praised this project for having a "rock-solid UI". </p>
